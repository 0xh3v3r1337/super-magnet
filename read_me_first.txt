Welcome to 'SuperMagnet' - one of the purest program you could expect to see.
The files contained within this archive were originally written in Amiga
AMOS BASIC and I have converted them to text.
I have tried my best to give descriptions of the code where appropriate,
but if you should have any questions, don't hesitate to contact
me at: dspwhite@email.com

It is my future ambition for the program to be converted to a fully configurable
Windows/Amiga OS GUI interface with full control over the various options etc.
See www.skytopia.com/project/magnet/magnet.html for a more detailed description.

The first files you should look at are the "code.txt" and "help.txt" files.

I have also included an example module. A very simple module will contain
all the necessary information to be held in just a few kilobytes, but this
'mincer' module shows what can be done with some invention (20k).
